## So..
Yep! It's a Sketch plugin that will let you insert any website's favicon, and iOS/Android app's icon into your design

The plugin was originally made for our use in the Product Design team at [Similarweb](http://similarweb.com "Similarweb"), and hopefully some of you out there will also find it useful :)  

The plugin uses the Google Favicon API for Favicons, an [import.io API](http://import.io API) for Google Play app icons, and the Apple Search API for App Store app icons.

## How to use:
1. Install by downloading ([download link](https://github.com/sagishrieber/sketch-get-favicon-by-url/archive/master.zip "download")), unziping, and then double clicking the "get me a favicon.sketchplugin" file.
2. In Sketch, Create a 16x16px rectangle for favicons, or a bigger icon (can be up to 512x512 in some cases) for App Store/Google Play icons. Make sure the rectangle is selected.
3. Use the shortcuts of cmd+ctrl+shift+f for Favicon,cmd+ctrl+shift+G for Google Play icons, cmd+ctrl+shift+a for App Store icons. You can also simply choose from the top menu "Plugins --> Fetch that icon for me will you?" and it will do the trick.
4. Enter any URL for favicons, or app name for Google Play/App Store icons. Voila! Enjoy.

## Shout Outs
This plugin is based off of [Tobi Kremer's](https://github.com/soulchild "Tobi Kremer on Github") who has built the excellent [Company Logo Fetcher for Sketch](https://github.com/soulchild/sketch-logo-fetcher).
Big Thanks to the support of [import.io](http://import.io API) for helping me build the Google Play icon API.
